SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       int strcmp(const char *s1, const char *s2);

       int strncmp(const char *s1, const char *s2, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The strcmp() function compares the two strings s1 and s2.  The locale is not taken into
       account (for a locale-aware comparison, see strcoll(3)).  The comparison is done  using
       unsigned characters.

       strcmp() returns an integer indicating the result of the comparison, as follows:

       • 0, if the s1 and s2 are equal;

       • a negative value if s1 is less than s2;

       • a positive value if s1 is greater than s2.

       The  strncmp() function is similar, except it compares only the first (at most) n bytes
       of s1 and s2.

RETURN VALUE
       The strcmp() and strncmp() functions return an integer less than, equal to, or  greater
       than zero if s1 (or the first n bytes thereof) is found, respectively, to be less than,
       to match, or be greater than s2.

# Docker Infrastructure

## Overview

This project now uses a single production-grade Docker stack.

Core services:
- frontend (Nginx + HTTPS on 4443)
- game-service (WebSocket backend)
- auth-service (FastAPI auth)
- postgres (database)

The stack is defined in `docker/compose.prod.yml`.

```bash
make certs         # Generate SSL certs (first run)
make prod          # Build and start stack
make prod-down     # Stop stack
make prod-logs     # Follow logs
make prod-rebuild  # Rebuild and restart

make status        # Running containers
make clean         # Remove containers/images/volumes
```

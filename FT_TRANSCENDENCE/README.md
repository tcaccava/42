## Individual Contributions

### Lpennisi

* **Contributions:** Managed the github repository and Implemented the frontend game view.
* **Challenges:** 
1. Synchronizing game state between client and server has been the major challenge, it has been overcome by implementing a robust event-driven architecture with a rigorous protocol for state updates.
2. Maintaining a clean and working repository has been a challenge when multiple branches and features were being developed simultaneously, it has been overcome by enforcing the use of Github Issues.

### Atucci

* **Contributions:** Designed and implemented the frontend interface of the Web-app.
* **Challenges:** 
1. To learn a new frontend framework (Vue.js) and to implement a complex UI with reusable components was the major challenge. It has been overcome by following Vue.js documentation and best practices, and by creating a design system to ensure consistency across the application.

### Abkhefif

* **Contributions:** Designed and implemented the REST backend, including JWT authentication, database schema with SQLAlchemy, and API endpoints for user management, matches, achievements, and statistics.
* **Challenges:** 
1. Learning REST API architecture and backend development with Python and FastAPI from scratch. Overcome by studying the documentation and iterating on the code structure to achieve a clean separation of concerns.

### Tcaccava

* **Contributions:** 

Designed the full game backend — including physics engine, real-time WebSocket server, lobby system, and Docker containerization. Developed a normalized coordinate system for multi-player Pong supporting 2 to 4 simultaneous players with dynamic wall bounce when sides are unoccupied. Implemented a 60fps server-side game loop with asyncio, AABB collision detection with angular bounce, client-side prediction support via input reconciliation, and a lobby queue with automatic slot promotion on disconnect. 

* **Challenges:**
 
1. Managing concurrent WebSocket coroutines,one for each connected player + the world loop one, safely in a single-threaded asyncio environment was the primary challenge. Race conditions on rapid reconnection (page refresh during a match) caused cascading disconnections across all connected clients. Identifying the root cause was extremely difficult and took days of hard work: the root cause was asyncio.gather propagating exceptions from dead WebSockets into active player coroutines. Solved by adding return_exceptions=True to all gather calls and introducing WebSocket ownership verification before clearing player slots in the disconnect handler.
2. Designing a game state architecture that supports variable player counts (2 to 4) without breaking the physics, scoring, or lobby logic required careful separation between slot state and connection state — a distinction that also proved critical for handling disconnections and reconnections gracefully during an active match.

## AI Usage

AI tools were used during the project for the following tasks:

* **ChatGPT chatbot** has been used to learn the FastAPI theory.
* **Gemini chatbot** has been used to learn python basics and Typing/Pydantic Library as well as specific vueJS concepts.
This AI has also been used to discuss on ideas of implementation to find lacks and gather suggestions on how to set a correct architecture for the project.
* **Github Copilot** has been used to speed up the development process by providing code suggestions, autocompletions and understand the reason behind some tedious bugs.
* **Github Copilot Agent** has been used to complete repetitive coding tasks, such as replace css styles with new ones after a design change, and to generate documentation to interface the frontend with the backend.

* **Claude chatbot** has been used to learn Python basics and FastAPI framework concepts for backend development.
